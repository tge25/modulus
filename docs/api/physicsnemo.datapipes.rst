PhysicsNeMo Datapipes provides a collection of data loading and processing utilities designed
to handle various types of physics-based datasets. The datapipes are organized into several
categories to support different types of physics simulations and machine learning tasks.

The datapipes in PhysicsNeMo are built on top of PhysicsNeMo's DataPipe class and provide
specialized implementations for handling physics simulation data, climate data,
graph-based data, and mesh-based data. Each category of datapipes is designed to efficiently
load and preprocess specific types of physics datasets.

The example below shows how to use a typical datapipe in PhysicsNeMo:

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.datapipes.benchmarks.darcy import Darcy2D

    def main():
        # Create a datapipe for Darcy flow simulation data
        datapipe = Darcy2D(
            batch_size=32,
            device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
        )

        # Iterate through the datapipe
        for batch in datapipe:
            # batch contains input features and target values
            input_features = batch["permeability"]
            target_values = batch["darcy"]

            # Use the data for training or inference
            ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

Here's another example showing how to use the ERA5HDF5Datapipe for weather data processing:

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.datapipes.climate.era5_hdf5 import ERA5HDF5Datapipe

    def main():
        # Create a datapipe for ERA5 weather data in HDF5 format
        datapipe = ERA5HDF5Datapipe(
            data_dir="path/to/era5/data",
            stats_dir="path/to/era5/stats",
            channels=[0, 1],
            latlon_resolution=(721, 1440),
            shuffle=True,
        )

        # Iterate through the datapipe
        for batch in datapipe:
            invar = batch[0]["invar"]
            outvar = batch[0]["outvar"]

            # Use the data for weather prediction or analysis
            ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
