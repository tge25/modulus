### Hello world

You can start using PhysicsNeMo in your PyTorch code as simple as shown here:

```python
python
>>> import torch
>>> from physicsnemo.models.mlp.fully_connected import FullyConnected
>>> model = FullyConnected(in_features=32, out_features=64)
>>> input = torch.randn(128, 32)
>>> output = model(input)
>>> output.shape
torch.Size([128, 64])
```

To use the distributed module, you can do the following (Example for
distributed data parallel training. For a more in-depth tutorial refer
[PhysicsNeMo Distributed](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-core/api/physicsnemo.distributed.html#)):

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel
from physicsnemo.distributed import DistributedManager
from physicsnemo.models.mlp.fully_connected import FullyConnected

def main():
    DistributedManager.initialize()
    dist = DistributedManager()
    
    arch = FullyConnected(in_features=32, out_features=64).to(dist.device)
    
    if dist.distributed:
        ddps = torch.cuda.Stream()
        with torch.cuda.stream(ddps):
            arch = DistributedDataParallel(
                arch,
                device_ids=[dist.local_rank],
                output_device=dist.device,
                broadcast_buffers=dist.broadcast_buffers,
                find_unused_parameters=dist.find_unused_parameters,
            )
        torch.cuda.current_stream().wait_stream(ddps)

    # Set up the optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
        arch.parameters(),
        lr=0.001,
    )

    def training_step(invar, target):
        pred = arch(invar)
        loss = torch.sum(torch.pow(pred - target, 2))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss

    # Sample training loop
    for i in range(20):
        # Random inputs and targets for simplicity
        input = torch.randn(128, 32, device=dist.device)
        target = torch.randn(128, 64, device=dist.device)

        # Training step
        loss = training_step(input, target)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use the PDE module, you can do the following:

## Installation

The following instructions help you install the base PhysicsNeMo modules to get started.
There are additional optional dependencies for specific models that are listed under
[optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies).
The training recipes are not packaged into the pip wheels or the container to keep the
footprint low. We recommend users clone the appropriate training recipes and use them
as a starting point. These training recipes may require additional dependencies
specific to the use case and they come with the requirements file.

### PyPi

The recommended method for installing the latest version of PhysicsNeMo is using PyPi:

```Bash
pip install nvidia-physicsnemo
```

The installation can be verified by running the [hello world](#hello-world) example.

#### Optional dependencies

PhysicsNeMo has many optional dependencies that are used in specific components.
When using pip, all dependencies used in PhysicsNeMo can be installed with
`pip install nvidia-physicsnemo[all]`. If you are developing PhysicsNeMo, developer dependencies
can be installed using `pip install nvidia-physicsnemo[dev]`. Otherwise, additional dependencies
can be installed on a case by case basis. Detailed information on installing the
optional dependencies can be found in the
[Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/getting-started/index.html).

### NVCR Container

The recommended PhysicsNeMo docker image can be pulled from the
[NVIDIA Container Registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/physicsnemo/containers/physicsnemo)
(refer to the NGC registry for the latest tag):

```Bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06
```

Inside the container, you can clone the PhysicsNeMo git repositories and get
started with the examples. The below command shows the instructions to launch
the physicsnemo container and run examples from this repo.

```bash
docker run --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --runtime nvidia \
--rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06 bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo.git
cd physicsnemo/examples/cfd/darcy_fno/
pip install warp-lang # install NVIDIA Warp to run the darcy example
python train_fno_darcy.py
```

## From Source

### Package

For a local build of the PhysicsNeMo Python package from source use:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/physicsnemo.git && cd physicsnemo

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

### Source Container

To build PhysicsNeMo docker image:

```bash
docker build -t physicsnemo:deploy \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target deploy -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-deploy`

To build CI image:

```bash
docker build -t physicsnemo:ci \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target ci -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-ci`.

Currently, only `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms are supported. If using
`linux/arm64`, some dependencies like `warp-lang` might not install correctly.

## PhysicsNeMo Migration Guide

NVIDIA Modulus has been renamed to NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo. For migration:

- Use `pip install nvidia-physicsnemo` rather than `pip install nvidia-modulus`
  for PyPi wheels.
- Use `nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:<tag>` rather than
  `nvcr.io/nvidia/modulus/modulus:<tag>` for Docker containers.
- Replace `nvidia-modulus` by `nvidia-physicsnemo` in your pip requirements
  files (`requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
- In your code, change the import statements from `import modulus` to
  `import physicsnemo`

The old PyPi registry and the NGC container registry will be deprecated soon
and will not receive any bug fixes/updates. The old checkpoints will remain
compatible with these updates.

More details to follow soon.
