# Transolver for Darcy Flow

This example demonstrates how to set up a data-driven model for a 2D Darcy flow
using the Transolver inside of PhysicsNeMo.

Training progress can be tracked through
[MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). This example runs on a
single GPU.

## Problem overview

This example is based on a 2D Darcy flow problem, which is often used to model
flow diffusion through a porous medium. The equation describes the steady-state
pressure and velocity field (related by the constitutive relation, based on
Darcy's law) for some fluid of interest. As an applied example, one might
consider a geological example, where the fluid is oil which is both a) generated
by a source term $f(\mathbf{x})$ and b) diffusing through porous bedrock with
permeability $k(\mathbf{x})$. For isotropic media, the governing equation is
given as the following second-order elliptic PDE:

$$ \nabla \cdot \left(\,k(\mathbf{x})\ \nabla p \left(\mathbf{x}\right)\,\right)
= f(\mathbf{x}) $$

where $\mathbf{x} \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the spatial coordinate,
$p(\mathbf{x})$ is the pressure, $k(\mathbf{x})$ is the local permeability and
$f(\mathbf{x})$ is the source term.

## Dataset

For the baseline case defined in `train_transolver_darcy.py`, the dataset is
generated on-the-fly at train time via the `Darcy2D` Datapipe described in
`./physicsnemo/datapipes/benchmarks/darcy.py`.

For the modified case with a fixed (i.e., precomputed) dataset defined in
`train_transolver_darcy_fix.py`, the dataset is pre-generated, and loaded via
the `Darcy2D_fix` Datapipe. In the fixed case, extra data is needed for training
and the data path should be added when `Darcy_2D_fix` dataset is constructed.
You can download the data

## Model overview and architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies by running below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

To train the model following PhysicsNeMo's settings, simply run:

```bash
python train_transolver_darcy.py
```

Each batch is a new data generated by equation, which is different from
commonly-used settings.

To reproduce the results in the paper, run:

```bash
python train_transolver_darcy_fix.py
```

In this case, the train set and test set are fixed after the construction of
Dataset, corresponding to Transolver's setting.

### Customization

To train Transolver on the same 2D Darcy flow problem with different physical
parameters or ML hyperparameters, modify the `config.yaml` file.

To train Transolver on your own physics problem, modify the `dataloader` in
`train_transolver_darcy.py` to use your own pre-computed data or on-the-fly
solver.

## Additional Information

More components are added for convenience. `Validators` calculate the loss
between ground-truth and prediction, and visualize them in `./mlruns`. Below is
a simple example of visualization.
