# StormCast: Kilometer-Scale Convection Allowing Model Emulation using Generative Diffusion Modeling

## Problem overview

Convection-allowing models (CAMs) are essential tools for forecasting severe thunderstorms and 
mesoscale convective systems, which are responsible for some of the most extreme weather events. 
By resolving kilometer-scale convective dynamics, these models provide the precision needed for 
accurate hazard prediction. However, modeling the atmosphere at this scale is both challenging
and expensive.

This example demonstrates how to run training and simple inference for [StormCast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10958),
a generative diffusion model designed to emulate NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, a 3km 
operational CAM. StormCast autoregressively predicts multiple atmospheric state variables with remarkable
accuracy, demonstrating ability to replicate storm dynamics, observed radar reflectivity, and realistic
atmospheric structure via deep learning-based CAM emulation. StormCast enables high-resolution ML-driven
regional weather forecasting and climate risk analysis.

The design of StormCast relies on two neural networks:
 1. A regression model, which provides a deterministic estimate of the next HRRR timestep given the previous timestep's HRRR and background ERA5 states
 2. A diffusion model, which is given the previous HRRR timestep as well as the estimate from the regression model, and provides a correction to the regression model estimate to produce a final high-quality prediction of the next high-resolution atmospheric state.

Much like other data-driven weather models, StormCast can make longer forecasts (more than one timestep) during inference by feeding its predictions back into the model as input for the next step (autoregressive rollout). The regression and diffusion components are trained separately (with the diffusion model training requiring a regression model as prerequisite), then coupled together in inference. Note that in the above description, we specifically name HRRR and ERA5 as the regional high-resolution and global coarse-resolution data sources/targets, respectively, but the StormCast setting should generalize to any regional/global coupling of interest. In the code, we refer to the high-resolution state updated by StormCast as `state` and to the low-resolution data source as `background`.

## Getting started

### Preliminaries
Start by installing PhysicsNeMo (if not already installed) and copying this folder (`examples/weather/stormcast`) to a system with a GPU available. Also, prepare a combined HRRR/ERA5 dataset in the form specified in `utils/data_loader_hrrr_era5.py` or implement a custom dataset class as shown below under [Adding custom datasets](#adding-custom-datasets). (**Note: subsequent versions of this example will include more detailed dataset preparation instructions**)

### Configuration basics

StormCast training is handled by `train.py`, configured using [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) based on the contents of the `config` directory. Hydra allows for YAML-based modular and hierarchical configuration management and supports command-line overrides for quick testing and experimentation. The `config` directory includes the following subdirectories:
 - `dataset`: specifies the dataset used for training as well as the resolution, number of variables, and other parameters of the dataset
 - `model`: specifies the model type and model-specific hyperparameters
 - `sampler`: specifies hyperparameters used in the sampling process for diffusion models
 - `training`: specifies training-specific hyperparameters and settings like checkpoint/log frequency and where to save training outputs
 - `inference` specifies inference-specific settings like which initial condition to run, which model checkpoints to use, etc.
 - `hydra`: specifies basic hydra settings, like where to store outputs (based on the training or inference outputs directories)

Also in the `config` directory are several top-level configs which show how to train a `regression` model or a `diffusion` model, and run inference (`stormcast-inference`). One can select any of these by specifying it as a config name at the command line (e.g., `--config-name=regression`); optionally one can also override any specific items of interest via command line args, e.g.:
```bash
python train.py --config-name regression training.batch_size=4
```

More extensive configuration modifications can be made by creating a new top-level configuration file similar to `regression` or `diffusion`. See `diffusion.yaml` for an example of how to specify a top-level config that uses default configuration settings with additional custom modifications added on top.

At runtime, hydra will parse the config subdirectory and command line over-rides into a runtime configuration object `cfg`, which will have all settings accessible via both attribute or dictionary-like interfaces. For example, the total training batch size can be accessed either as `cfg.training.batch_size` or `cfg['training']['batch_size']`.

The training script `train.py` will initialize the training experiment and launch the main training loop, which is defined in `utils/trainer.py`. Outputs (training logs, checkpoints, etc.) will be saved to a directory specified by the following `training` config items:
```yaml
training.outdir: 'rundir' # Root path under which to save training outputs
training.experiment_name: 'stormcast' # Name for the training experiment
training.run_id: '0' # Unique ID to use for this training run 
training.rundir: ./${training.outdir}/${training.experiment_name}/${training.run_id} # Path where experiement outputs will be saved
```
As you can see, the `training.run_id` setting can be used for distinguishing between different runs of the same configuration. The final training output directory is constructed by composing together the `training.outdir` root path (defaults to `rundir`), the `training.experiment_name`, and the `training.run_id`. For inference runs, equivalent options are available in the `stormcast_inference.yaml` config file used with the `inference.py` script.

## Training StormCast

### Training the regression model
To train the default StormCast regression model, simply specify the example `regression` config and an optional name for the training experiment:
```bash
python train.py --config-name regression training.experiment_name=regression
```
To test training on a single-GPU machine, you can use `--config-name regression_lite` to run a quick training with a small batch size (but not expected to produce useful checkpoints).

To customize which inputs are used for the regression model, you can change the list in `model.regression_conditions`. The default of `["state", "background", "invariant"]` corresponds to the StormCast paper. By changing the default you can, for instance, train a model that uses only the background data or the state data for benchmarking purposes.

### Training the diffusion model

The method for launching a diffusion model training looks almost identical, and we just have to change the configuration name appropriately. Also, the inputs are specified by the `model.diffusion_conditions` option instead. To train a diffusion model that uses the regression model output, there are two config items that must be defined:
  1. `'regression'` included in `model.diffusion_conditions`. This is included by default.
  2. `model.regression_weights` set to the path of a PhysicsNeMo (`.mdlus`) checkpoint with model weights for the pre-trained regression model. These are saved in the checkpoints directory during training.
Once again, the reference `diffusion.yaml` top-level config shows an example of how to specify these settings.

With that, launching diffusion training for the default StormCast configuration looks something like:
```bash
python train.py --config-name diffusion training.experiment_name=diffusion
```
Similar to regression, diffusion training can be tested using on a single GPU using `--config-name diffusion_lite`.

Note that the full training pipeline for StormCast diffusion model is fairly lengthy, requiring about 120 hours on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. However, more lightweight trainings can still produce decent models if the diffusion model is not trained for as long. The example `regression` and `diffusion` configs use the configuration used in the StormCast paper. New configs can be easily added [as described above](#configuration-basics).

### Distributed training

Both regression and diffusion training can be distributed easily with data parallelism via `torchrun` or other launchers (e.g., SLURM `srun`). As long as GPU memory is sufficient, the same configuration file can be used regardless of the number of GPUs. One just needs to ensure the configuration being run has a batch size that is divisible by the number of available GPUs/processes.  For example, distributed training of the regression model over 8 GPUs on one node would look something like:
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 train.py --config-name <your_distributed_training_config>
```

### Memory management

The default configuration uses a batch size of 64 (controlled by `training.batch_size`), as used in the StormCast paper. If you have few GPUs and/or GPUs with limited memory, the default setting of `training.batch_size_per_gpu: 'auto'` may cause you to run out of memory. In that case, you can reduce the per-GPU memory utilization by manually setting `training.batch_size_per_gpu` to an integer value smaller than `training.batch_size` divided by the number of GPUs. The StormCast training code will automatically employ gradient accumulation to maintain the desired effective batch size specified by `training.batch_size` while using less memory, at the cost of longer training time.

Another way to reduce memory usage is to enable 16-bit training by setting `training.fp_optimizations` to `amp-bf16`. This is not enabled by default as it was not used in the StormCast paper, but our experience indicates that BF16 training works as well as 32-bit training.

## Inference

When the training-time validation is run, simple examples of model inference are saved in the `images` subdirectory in your `run` directory.

A simple demonstrative inference script is given in `inference.py`, which is also configured using hydra in a manner similar to training. The reference `stormcast_inference` config shows an example inference config, which looks largely the same as a training config except the output directory is now controlled by the settings from `inference` rather than `training` config:
```yaml
inference.outdir: 'rundir' # Root path under which to save inference outputs
inference.experiment_name: 'stormcast-inference' # Name for the inference experiment being run
inference.run_id: '0' # Unique identifier for the inference run
inference.rundir: ./${inference.outdir}/${inference.experiment_name}/${inference.run_id} # Path where experiment outputs will be saved
```

To run inference, simply do:
```bash
python inference.py --config-name <your_inference_config>
```

This will load regression and diffusion models from directories specified by `inference.regression_checkpoint` and `inference.diffusion_checkpoint` respectively; each of these should be a path to a PhysicsNeMo checkpoint (`.mdlus` file) from your training runs. The `inference.py` script will use these models to run a forecast and save outputs as a `zarr` file along with a few plots saved as `png` files.

The `inference.py` script currently fully supports only the default ERA5-HRRR StormCast implementation. For custom datasets and more complex inference workflows, we recommend bringing your checkpoints to [Earth2Studio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio) for further analysis and visualizations. The [Earth2Studio wrapper for StormCast](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio/blob/main/earth2studio/models/px/stormcast.py) can be used as a starting point for custom implementations.


## Datasets

### ERA5-HRRR dataset

With the default configuration, StormCast is trained on the [HRRR dataset](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/),
conditioned on the [ERA5 dataset](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5).
The datapipe in this example is tailored specifically for the domain and problem setting posed in the 
[original StormCast preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10958), namely a subset of HRRR and ERA5 variables
in a region over the Central US with spatial extent 1536km x 1920km.

A custom dataset object is defined in `datasets/data_loader_hrrr_era5.py`, which loads temporally-aligned samples from HRRR and ERA5, interpolated to the same grid and normalized appropriately. This data pipeline requires the HRRR and ERA5 data to abide by a specific `zarr` format and for other datasets, you will need to [create a custom datapipe](#adding-custom-datasets). The table below lists the variables used to train StormCast -- in total there are 26 ERA5 variables used and 99 HRRR variables (along with 2 static HRRR invariants, the land/water mask and orography).

### Adding custom datasets

While it is possible to train StormCast on custom datasets by formatting them indentically to the Zarr datasets used in the ERA5-HRRR example, a more flexible option is to define a custom dataset object. These datasets must follow the `StormCastDataset` interface defined in `datasets/base.py`; see the docstrings in that file for a specification of what the functions must accept and return. You can use the `datasets/data_loader_hrrr_era5.py` implementation as an example. 

Once you have implemented the custom dataset, create a configuration file in `config/dataset`. This configuration file must have one special attribute, `name`. This indicates a module in the `datasets` directory and a class to be used for the dataset. For instance, specifying `name: data_loader_hrrr_era5.HrrrEra5Dataset` will use the default ERA5-HRRR dataset, found in `datasets/data_loader_hrrr_era5.py`. The other parameters in the dataset configuration file will be passed to the `params` object used to initialize the dataset and can be used to specify e.g. the file system path from which the dataset is loaded.

## Logging

These scripts use Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, which can be enabled by setting `training.log_to_wandb=True`. Academic accounts are free to create at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/).
Once you have an account set up, you can adjust `entity` and `project` in `train.py` to the appropriate names for your `wandb` workspace.
